# AP Physics C

Three fifths of the lab reports and the TOPS AP Physics Experience.

## Why did you write LaTeX formatted lab reports for an AP class?

It's a bit of a misnomer, but the class is not related to the actual AP test.

The curriculum covers many concepts not usually seen until first or second year undergraduate at most universities. In my year, we covered (in order of difficulty wrt me): classical mechanics, light and (introductory) quantum mechanics, linear ODEs, waves, electromagnetism (ending at Maxwell's equations).

Of course, you can't judge the difficulty of a course solely based on the curriculum, because it's difficult to tell how deep we went into every subject. We had weekly tests, monthly labs (that's what those lab reports are for), and a culminating (which I might upload).
